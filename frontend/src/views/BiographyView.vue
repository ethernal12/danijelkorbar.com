      <h3>Final controle technician</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        My job entailed conducting final stress test for varistors, which are
        used to protect against excessive transient voltages. While working
        there I had my first real world encounter with programming in the form
        of the Excel`s macros. After doing the before mentioned stress tests I
        had to fill out a lenghty report every time a specific test was
        conducted. As my work load got heavier I was looking for a way to
        expedite my work, so I resorted to study how Excel macros are recorded
        so my work flow would be accelerated and be more precise. After seeing
        how much easier and hassle-free my work was from that point on I really
        appriciated the automation aspect of programming and it`s real world
        applications.

      <h3>Line maintenance technician / night shift leader</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        My job entailed maintaining the uninterrupted line process of INVASIVE
        BLOOD PRESSURE MEASUREMENT devices. At that job I learned the importance
        of communication with co-workers especially working in the night shift
        where sometimes tensions got a little high and it was crucial to keep
        workers motivated and concentrated so the process line was not effected.
