      <h3>Job title:</h3>
      <h3>Final controle technician</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        My job entailed conducting final stress test for varistors, which are
        used to protect against excessive transient voltages. While working
        there I had my first real world encounter with programming in the form
        of the Excel`s macros. After doing the before mentioned stress tests I
        had to fill out a lenghty report every time a specific test was
        conducted. As my work load got heavier I was looking for a way to
        expedite my work, so I resorted to study how Excel macros are recorded
        so my work flow would be accelerated and be more precise. After seeing
        how much easier and hassle-free my work was from that point on I really
        appriciated the automation aspect of programming and it`s real world
        applications.

      <h3>Job title:</h3>
      <h3>Line maintenance technician / night shift leader</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        My job entailed maintaining the uninterrupted line process of INVASIVE
        BLOOD PRESSURE MEASUREMENT devices. At that job I learned the importance
        of communication with co-workers especially working in the night shift
        where sometimes tensions got a little high and it was crucial to keep
        workers motivated and concentrated so the process line was not effected.

        2021 (2 months) - Complete DApp - Solidity & React - Blockchain
        Development by Clarian North
      </h4>
      <p>
        The main objective of this course was to learn Solidity, Web3, React,
        Mocha and Ethereum Blockchain Programming for Front-end development. The
        course learned me the proccess of developing, testing,
        migrating smart contracts to the blockchain and connecting
        backend(smart contracts) to the frontend, so the user can interact with
        the blockchain.

        2021 - 2022 (6 months) Solidity & Ethereum in React (Next JS): The
        Complete Guide by Filip Jerga
      </h4>
      <p>
        The main objective of this course was to learn the inner workings of the
        blockchain, develop smart contracts with Solidity and learn react and
        NextJS to build decentralized applications. The course was fantastic as
        it`s teacher Filip gave quality presentation and almost instant feedback
        when encountered with problems. Although this was the first big React
        based project, I really learned about how React works and later when I
        was finished with the course, builded a DAO(decentralized autonomous
        organization) application based on the knowledge I learned in this
        course. While I was working on the course and did smart contract backend
        testing with Chai I realized that I enjoyed the process of a structural
        testing procedure. It was something really satisfying about testing for
        every smart contract condition and passing all the tests with flying
        colors, well... in my case, with green checkmarks. chemical process of a particual
