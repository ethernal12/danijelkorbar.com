      <h2>My programming journey</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        As far as I can remember I was fascinated with programming. The sheer
        fact of something comming alive by typing a few characters, numbers and
        commands was mind boggling.
        As much as I was dazzled with the idea of programming and a programming
        education leading to a profession, for some reason I chose the field of
        electronics.
        <br />
        <br />
        Like I described in my biography it wasn`t until my job where I decided
        to learn Excel`s macros that I found my love and appreciation for
        programming. As of that point on I always dabbled with a few projects
        here and there be it programming simple games, learning javascript
        through various applications and learning to build web sites with
        DreamWeaver.
        <br />
        <br />
        In 2018 I was introduced to blockchain and the programming language
        Solidity which is used to program smart contracts and from that point on
        I decided to turn all my focus into learning how to develop 
        decentralized applications and testing smart contracts.
<br />
        Here are some technologies Iâ€™ve been working with recently: 
        <ul>
        <li>Javascript</li>
        <li>Node.js</li>
        <li>Postman</li>
        <li>Selenium</li>
        <li>Selenium IDE</li>
</ul>
