        2021 (2 months) - Complete DApp - Solidity & React - Blockchain
        Development by Clarian North
      </h4>
      <p>
        The main objective of this course was to learn Solidity, Web3, React,
        Mocha and Ethereum Blockchain Programming for Front-end development. The
        course learned me the proccess of developing, testing,
        migrating smart contracts to the blockchain and connecting
        backend(smart contracts) to the frontend, so the user can interact with
        the blockchain.

        2021 - 2022 (6 months) Solidity & Ethereum in React (Next JS): The
        Complete Guide by Filip Jerga
      </h4>
      <p>
        The main objective of this course was to learn the inner workings of the
        blockchain, develop smart contracts with Solidity and learn react and
        NextJS to build decentralized applications. The course was fantastic as
        it`s teacher Filip gave quality presentation and almost instant feedback
        when encountered with problems. Although this was the first big React
        based project, I really learned about how React works and later when I
        was finished with the course, builded a DAO(decentralized autonomous
        organization) application based on the knowledge I learned in this
        course. While I was working on the course and did smart contract backend
        testing with Chai I realized that I enjoyed the process of a structural
        testing procedure. It was something really satisfying about testing for
        every smart contract condition and passing all the tests with flying
        colors, well... in my case, with green checkmarks.
